Assignment No-1 Implement the Heap/Shell sort algorithm in Java

Assignment No- 2 Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting the values 
in the order given. After constructing a binary tree-
i) Insert new node
ii) Find number of nodes in
longest path
iii) Minimum data value found in
the tree
iv) Search a value.

Assignment No-3 Construct expression tree e.g. a-b*c-d/ e+ fand traverse it using postorder traversal
(non- recursive). Change a tree so that theroles of the left and right pointers are
swapped at every node

Assignment No-4 A Dictionary stores keywords and itsmeanings. Provide facility for adding new
keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to
display whole data sorted in ascending /descending order. Also find how many
maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword .Use Binary search
tree for implementation.

Assignment No-5 Convert a given binary tree into threaded binary tree. Analyze time and space
complexity of the algorithm.

Assignment No-6 There are flight paths between cities. If there is a flight between city A and city B
then there is an edge between the cities. The cost of the edge can be the time that flight
takes to reach city B from a, or the amount of fuel used for the journey. Represent this
as a graph. The node can be represented by airport name or name of the city. Use
adjacency list representation of the graph or use adjacency matrix representation of the
graph. Justify the storage representation used.

Assignment No-7 Consider telephone book database of Nclients. Make use of hash table
implementation to quickly look up clientâ€™stelephone number.

Assignment No-8 Implement all the functions of a dictionary(ADT) using hashing.

Data: Set of(key, value) pairs, keys are mapped to values, keys must be
comparable, keys must be unique Standard Operations: Insert(key,
value),Find(key),Delete(key)

Assignment No-9 A dictionary stores keywords &amp; its meanings. Provide facility for adding new
keywords, deleting keywords, updating values of any entry. Provide facility to
display whole data sorted in ascending/descending order. Also find how
many maximum comparisons may require for finding any keyword. Use height
balance tree and find the complexity for finding a keyword.

Assignment No-10 Read the marks obtained by students of second year in an online examination of
particular subject. Find out maximum and minimum marks obtained in that subject.
Use heap data structure. Analyze the algorithm.

Assignment No-11 Department maintains student information.The file contains roll number, name,
division and address. Allow user to add, delete information of student. Display information of particular student. If record
of student does not exist an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the
system displays the student details. Use sequential file to maintain the data.

Assignment No-12 Write a program on template and exception handling in Java : in this assignment
multiple templates are to be designed as a pattern and these patterns to be used to take decisions.

Assignment No-13 Any application defining scope of formal parameter, global parameter, Local
parameter accessing mechanism and also relevance to private, public and protected
access. Write a Java program which demonstrates the scope rules of the programming mechanism
